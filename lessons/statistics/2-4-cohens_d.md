[Think Stats Chapter 2 Exercise 4](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2003.html#toc24) (Cohen's d)

firsts.totalwgt_lb.mean(), others.totalwgt_lb.mean()

(7.201094430437772, 7.325855614973262)

This shows that first-born babies are lighter on average than others.

CohenEffectSize(firsts.prglngth, others.prglngth) = 0.028879044654449883
 
 
CohenEffectSize(firsts.totalwgt_lb, others.totalwgt_lb) = 0.088672927072602006
 
The larger Cohen's D for total weight shows that the effect size for total weight between the two groups is larger than for pregnancy length.
